# Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
A decentralized digital identity system that enables individuals to have complete control over their personal data and how it is shared. So, instead of using the physical elements to verify identity
which in most cases carry more information than needed, each individual will have the control on what to show.

# Key Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity
1. Ownership: Individuals maintain complete ownership and control over their digital identities, including the right to grant or revoke access to personal data.
2. Decentralization: SSI eliminates the need for centralized authorities or intermediaries by leveraging decentralized technologies to manage digital identities.
3. Privacy: SSI prioritizes user privacy by minimizing the collection and sharing of unnecessary personal information, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and identity theft.
4. Interoperability: SSI solutions are designed to be interoperable across different platforms and systems, enabling seamless identity verification and authentication processes.
